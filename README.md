# Basic OpenGL rendered game engine (Game Engine Version 4.5)

A larger improvement than the last iteration. A new bsp system would have been implemented using the Quake 3 BSP. Lightmaps for the scene have been added but no frustrum culling/
any sort of clipping would have been done yet. Using a custom interface system. Most subsystems would have been rewritten with the introduction of a register system to keep track of game values.
